                During the free trial period, you will have to complete the certification during the free trial
                period to be awarded the certificate.
                When the free trial period is over, and you end up purchasing the certificate,
                you can complete it at your own pace.

                Topcoder is new to the education space and we are working hard to find the right content
                partners to build more and better certifications for our members.

                this will become awesome.  We will get better, this is just the starting point.
