# Topcoder Review App - Deployment Guide

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration:

```env
# Topcoder API Configuration
REACT_APP_TOPCODER_API_URL=https://api.topcoder.com/v5
REACT_APP_TOPCODER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Deployment Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Additional Configuration Options
REACT_APP_CHALLENGE_TYPES=CODE,DESIGN,DATA_SCIENCE
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=10
REACT_APP_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30

# Optional: Performance and Logging
REACT_APP_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=false
REACT_APP_LOGGING_LEVEL=info
```

### Environment Variable Checklist
- [ ] Replace `your_api_key_here` with a valid Topcoder API key
- [ ] Verify API URL is correct for your deployment environment
- [ ] Configure challenge types as needed
- [ ] Set appropriate page size and timeout values

## Deployment Verification Checklist

### API Integration Points
1. **Authentication**
   - [ ] Verify API key works correctly
   - [ ] Test authentication for different user roles
   - [ ] Ensure proper error handling for invalid credentials

2. **Challenge Type Support**
   - [ ] Test CODE challenges
   - [ ] Test DESIGN challenges
   - [ ] Test DATA_SCIENCE challenges
   - [ ] Verify challenge type filtering works as expected

3. **Review Process Validation**
   - [ ] Submit reviews for different challenge types
   - [ ] Test draft saving functionality
   - [ ] Verify review status transitions
   - [ ] Check score calculation accuracy

### Performance and Compatibility
- [ ] Test with Node.js 16+
- [ ] Verify npm 8+ compatibility
- [ ] Check responsive design on multiple devices
- [ ] Validate cross-browser compatibility

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Run production build locally (optional)
npm run start:production
```

### 2. Deployment Strategies
- **Docker**: Use included Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- **Cloud Platforms**: Compatible with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- **Static Hosting**: Build files can be deployed to static hosting services

### 3. Post-Deployment Checks
- Verify all routes are working
- Check network requests in browser developer tools
- Test user authentication
- Validate challenge list and review functionality

## Troubleshooting
- If API calls fail, double-check API key and URL
- Clear browser cache if UI seems inconsistent
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Ensure network connectivity to Topcoder API

## Monitoring and Logging
Enable performance monitoring and logging in production by setting:
```env
REACT_APP_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
REACT_APP_LOGGING_LEVEL=warn
```

## Security Considerations
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment-specific `.env` files
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly rotate API credentials
