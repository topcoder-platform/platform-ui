const mockGuidelines = `
The challenge itself has a set of requirements that the submission should fulfill. During evaluation, the reviewer must verify that all requirements are met. This section deals with the major requirements - requirements, which when remain unfulfilled, contribute to the challenge's failure.
A submission not meeting the challenge requirements does not contribute to the challenge's success and jeopardizes the project deliverables and timelines.
Grade using a continuous 0 thru 9 scale - range includes:
* 0-2 - Multiple requirements are missing or were improperly implemented, and most major functionality is missing or does not work.
* 3-5 - A few important requirements are missing or were improperly implemented. Significant areas of the functionality are missing or do not work.
* 6-8 - The implementation takes into consideration all requirements, but there are some areas where one or more requirements are not fully addressed and necessary features are missing.
* 9 - The implementation fully addresses all requirements. All functionality can be used without any issues.
