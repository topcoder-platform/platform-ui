    <PageH2>STOCK ARTWORK POLICY</PageH2>
    <PageP>
      Your submission CANNOT contain any stock art, clipart, icons, or “free”
      elements from the web. All items you design and submit within a Topcoder
      Design Challenge must be created solely by you (as original artwork) or be
      provided by the client as part of the challenge inputs. Note, we treat
      icons differently.
    </PageP>
    <PageP>
      The exception to this rule is when a Design challenge allows Stock
      Artwork. Every challenge clearly states whether or not stock artwork is
      allowed. If the challenge allows it, you will need to abide by the
      following rules:
    </PageP>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You must document your Stock Artwork (photos, illustrations) when
        submitting. (This helps a customer find the Stock Artwork for purchasing
        or attribution later)
      </li>
      <li>
        You are allowed to use stock photos and stock illustrations. If you use
        any Stock Artwork (anything!) in your design it MUST BE DOCUMENTED. This
        includes Unsplash, Pexels, and client/ challenge provided artwork or
        photos.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are only allowed to use Stock Artwork from the provided websites:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/" target="_blank">

            </a>
          </li>
          <li>

            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Watermark: You MUST keep the stock watermark intact. If the photo is
        cropped in such a way that the watermark is not visible, please be sure
        to include the entire watermarked image in your source files so
        Screeners can review and see where the image is from. When using either
        Unsplash or Pexels, where a watermark is not included on the image,
        please add either “Unsplash” or “Pexels” text on top of the image
        somewhere.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <PageP>
      <strong>
        If the challenge does not allow Stock Artwork (photos or illustrations),
        it will clearly state this in the challenge details page.
      </strong>
    </PageP>
    <PageP>
      <strong>Stock Illustrations:</strong>
      Stock Illustrations are allowed but you must treat them like “stock
      photos”. You are NOT allowed to edit any illustration and claim it as your
      own artwork. You are not allowed to trace stock illustrations and claim
      them as your own artwork. Stock Illustrations MUST include proper
      watermarks and source documentation.
      <br />
      <strong>Personal Photos:</strong>
      You are allowed to create and use your own photography. Make sure to
      attribute the photo to yourself. If you include your own photography the
      licensing must be free for the customer to use (if you are a prize
      winner).
      <br />
      <strong>Client Supplied Assets:</strong>
      Any assets supplied as part of the challenge can be used in your designs.
      These assets MUST still be declared as part of your submission.

      <strong>Things to Remember</strong>
    </PageP>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We screen all design submissions for copyright infringement and proper
        source documentation.
      </li>
      <li>All designs must be created by you</li>
      <li>DO NOT COPY OR TRACE EXISTING ARTWORK</li>
      <li>
        Make sure you understand the Topcoder Terms, Official Design Contest
        Rules, and check each contest for more information and what is allowed
        in that challenge before you submit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>GENERAL FONT POLICIES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fonts only need to be declared in design challenges, not wireframe or
        idea generation challenges.
      </li>
      <li>
        All fonts you introduced within your design must be declared when you
        submit your design.
      </li>
      <li>Fonts must be from the Font sites listed below.</li>
      <li>You may not use symbol fonts (webdings, etc.)</li>
      <li>
        You must list the name, source, and URL of each font when submitting (We
        do this to help the Customer)
      </li>
      <li>
        In general, missing font documentation or two will not affect screening
        but Copilots will check source files and you will have to provide ALL
        font documentation in Final Fixes in order to get your full payment. It
        is best to do it correctly the first time.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have not introduced any new fonts then choose that option in the
        drop-down when you are declaring your fonts.
      </li>

    <PageH2>ICON POLICY</PageH2>
    <PageP>
      Topcoder Design Challenges either allow or disallow stock icons as part of
      the creative process. It is critical that you review what is allowed or
      not allowed in each challenge, and if the policy is not clear, you ask in
      the respective challenge forum.
    </PageP>
    <PageP>
      When stock icons are allowed, you must treat them like “stock photos.” You
      are not allowed to edit stock icons and claim them as your artwork. You
      are not allowed to trace stock icons and claim them as your artwork. Stock
      icons are only allowed in design challenges that allow “Stock Icons.”
      Stock icons do not require watermarks, but they do require proper source
      documentation and attribution.
    </PageP>
    <PageP>
      Every challenge clearly states whether or not Stock Icons are allowed. If
      the challenge allows stock icons, you will need to abide by the following
      rules:
    </PageP>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <PageP>You must document your Stock Icons when submitting.</PageP>

                Goal: Help customers find your stock Icons for purchase and

            </PageP>

      <li>
        <PageP>
          If you use any Stock Icons (anything!) in your design, it{" "}
          <strong>MUST BE DOCUMENTED</strong>.
        </PageP>
      </li>
      <li>
        <PageP>
          When documenting your icons, you must provide a link to every icon
          family you are using, or to each unique icon. It is essential that
          everything is easy to find and is from Topcoder approved sources.
        </PageP>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <PageP>
              Alternatively, you can provide the source only, disregarding each
              link. Nevertheless, you may be asked to disclose each link for
              each icon.
